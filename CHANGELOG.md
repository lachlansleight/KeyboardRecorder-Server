# Changelog

### v0.7.0

_23rd April 2022_

-   Duplicated recording metadata into a separate firebase key, so that it can be quickly pulled for displaying the home-page list
    -   At some point, I'll de-duplicate this as it's wasteful and means that all data operations need to happen twice...not to mention that it could become desynchronized. I doin't have time to do it right now, but at some point I'll switch the 'recordings' key to be a 'messages' key instead.

### v0.6.1

_9th April 2021_

I'll fill in this, and previous versions, another time. I'll be doing it 100% from the commit history anyway so if you must know, check there!
